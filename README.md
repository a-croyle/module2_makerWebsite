# Module 2: Maker Website
If you are in this course you are likely a maker of some sort. For this project you'll create an instructional or "how-to" website tied to a specific theme.

Your task is to creat an about page that provides a high level overview of the site and an example tutorial/how-to page (with the idea that the full site would have more than one tutorial) that includes a description/overview of the the thing you are making, materials, and the procedure.

## Requirements
- [ ] 2 HTML pages (about page and how-to page)
- [ ] CSS file (name this file styles.css)
- [ ] assets folder (with any images needed in it)
- [ ] docs folder (with live website in itâ€”remember to update all files in this folder if you make edits)
- [ ] code needs to be valid
- [ ] code needs to be accessible
- [ ] site needs to be published (i.e. "live" on the web)
